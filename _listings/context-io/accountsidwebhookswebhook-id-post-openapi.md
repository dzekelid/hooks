  title: Context.IO Post Accounts Webhooks Webhook
  description: |-
    Changes properties of a given WebHook. The only property of a WebHook that can be changed is it's active property. If you want to change the filters or callback urls, delete it and create a new one.
    Changing the active property can be useful in two cases:
    - Pause/resume WebHooks: If your application needs up-to-date information when users are logged in the best option is to keep a WebHook with no filters on that account that will be resumed (setting active to 1) when the user logs in and paused (setting active to 0) when the user logs out of your app.
    - Acting upon a failure notification: If a WebHook fails, your failure_notif_url is called (see creating a WebHook) an its active property becomes 0. Set the active property back to 1 to get it working again.
