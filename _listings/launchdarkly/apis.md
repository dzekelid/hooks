description: Our vision is to eliminate risk for developers and operations teams from
  the software development cycle. As companies transition to a world built on software,
  there is an increasing requirement to move quickly&mdash;but that often comes with
  the desire to maintain control. LaunchDarkly is the feature management platform
  that enables dev and ops teams to control the whole feature lifecycle, from concept
  to launch to value. Feature flagging is an industry best practice of wrapping a
  new or risky section of code or infrastructure change with a flag. Each flag can
  easily be turned on/off independent of code deployment (aka &rdquo;dark launching&rdquo;).
  Equipping businesses with the ability to move at the speed of every deploy allows
  an entire company to learn rapidly, deliver value to their customers faster, and
  produce more value. Developers can build, marketing can launch, product can iterate,
  and sales can sell.
